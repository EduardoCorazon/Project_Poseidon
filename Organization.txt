This is my current ideas for the project:

A full 3 stage attack system for specific targets in a local area.
Meaning this tool is idea for a local physcical attack on a specific target
    You would likely use this in a coffe shop
    This is mostly a full on tool to facilitate getting access instead a simple hotplug attack

I will be utilizng the Wifi Pinnaple and Bash Bunny from hak5 as my main/ first use of this tool

    Stage one: Recon
        1) import Wifi pinnaple results as a json file
        2) use aircrack to gather physcial location of item (echolocation)
        3) Take pictures of target and use facial OSINT tool
        4) add more OSINT

    Stage two: Payload settup and Config
        1) Select Attack vector 
            a. (first idea) Use metasploit API to actually make a payload [hotplug]
            b. add more later

    Stage three: Deplyment and post-attack
        1) Provide instructions for next steps
        2) Further devlopment 

This is a one stop shop for scipt kiddies and actual pentesters alike.
