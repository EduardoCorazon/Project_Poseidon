This is my current ideas for the project:

A full 3 stage attack system for specific targets in a local area.
Meaning this tool is idea for a local physcical attack on a specific target
    You would likely use this in a coffe shop
    This is mostly a full on tool to facilitate getting access instead a simple hotplug attack

I will be utilizng the Wifi Pinnaple and Bash Bunny from hak5 as my main/ first use of this tool

    Stage one: Recon
        1) import Wifi pinnaple results

    Stage two: Payload settup and Config
    Stage three: Deplyment and post-attack
