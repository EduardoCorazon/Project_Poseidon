DISCLAMER: PLEASE LIKE SERIOUSLY PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR ILLEGAL OR MALICIOUS PURPOSES

Description:
This project is meant to be a toolset to help further ease access to a system. It's meant to be run on **KALI Linux** so it can access other tools available in the system.
This is project is merely a toolset geared towards the social engineering side of things and is NOT for Penetration testing



The setup iss divded into 3 parts (in allusion to the Trident :D)
- Social Recon
  - This is mainly OSINT and other Social Tools to gather information about the target
- Deployment
  - This is the actual attack section
- Post Access
  - This is to esablish a reverse shell or make sure the attack worked successfully 

NOTE TO SELF:::::: Go back to drawing board again
